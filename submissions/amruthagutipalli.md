**Background:**  
I am a tech enthusiast with a deep interest in programming, open-source communities, and collaborative learning. I enjoy solving problems using code and continuously seek opportunities to expand my skills in software development. Though I’m still at the beginning of my journey, I love experimenting with new technologies and contributing to meaningful projects.

**One open-source project I admire:**  
One open-source project I truly admire is **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**. It's an incredibly versatile and lightweight code editor developed by Microsoft, yet fully open-source. What I find inspiring is how it empowers developers across the world—beginners and experts alike—with support for extensions, themes, and multiple languages. Its active community and transparent development process make it a great example of how powerful collaborative software can be.

**What I hope to learn:**  
By joining this open-source initiative, I hope to build confidence using Git and GitHub, understand real-world version control workflows, and get comfortable collaborating on public repositories. I want to move beyond tutorials and classroom code to actively contribute to real projects and learn from the open-source community. This is the first step in a journey I’m excited to continue long-term.
