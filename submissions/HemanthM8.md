## Background
I'm a computer science student passionate about AI/ML and Web Development.

## Open source project I admire
I really admire the [Langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) project. This package helps developers build AI tools like agents, RAGs with ease.

## What I hope to learn
I like to explore things and as a part of it I am doing this. Some things are new and I try to understand them and use them when required.
