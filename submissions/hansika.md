## 💡 Open-Source Project I Admire

One project I truly admire is my own work on:

### 🐟 Fish Disease Detection using CNN and SVM

In this project, I used **MobileNetV2** and **EfficientNetB0** for deep feature extraction, and built a **hybrid classification pipeline** with **SVM** for detecting diseases in freshwater fish. The goal was to help farmers and aquaculture professionals diagnose diseases early using image-based analysis.

> 📌 Techniques used: MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, PCA, SMOTE, SVM, and custom CNN architectures.
