## Name and Background
Hi, I’m Pavan! I’m a B.Tech 2nd-year student at griet, interested in software development, tech communities, and open-source learning. I’m currently learning full-stack development and want to build meaningful tech projects.

## One Open-Source Project I Admire
I admire **Bootstrap**, a powerful open-source front-end framework used to build responsive and mobile-first websites easily. It helps developers quickly prototype UI designs with its pre-built components and grid system, and it's widely used in both beginner and professional projects.

## What I Hope to Learn from This Club
I want to learn GitHub collaboration, improve my coding skills, understand the open-source workflow, and contribute to real-world projects. I’m also excited to meet other student developers in the CBIT community.
