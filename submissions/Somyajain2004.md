## Somya Jain

### Background
I'm a computer science student passionate about web development and AI.

### Open Source Project I Admire
I really admire the [Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) project. It's a fantastic visual guide that helps developers understand what they should learn next.

### What I Hope to Learn
Iâ€™m doing this as part of my daily coding discipline to stay consistent and learn something new every day. Through this club, I hope to build the habit of contributing regularly while learning something new everyday.
