# Hi, I'm Umaima

## Background
I'm a BTech student just stepping into the world of open source. I’m passionate about robotics, automation, and real-world tech projects! I’ve worked with Python, Arduino, OpenCV, and MediaPipe etc and I love building things that move or react!

## Open-source Project I Admire
I truly admire OpenCV. It's incredibly helpful in building gesture-based and face recognition systems. It made my robotics journey more exciting and visual.

## What I Hope to Learn
Through this challenges, I want to gain confidence in contributing to real-world projects, learn teamwork in tech, and grow as an open source enthusiast.
