## Background
I'm a student at Muffakham Jah College of Engineering and Technology, based in Hyderabad, India. I enjoy building useful tools and exploring new tech, especially in the frontend and web development space.

## One Open-Source Project I Admire
I really admire the [sonangrai/imagecropNextJS](https://github.com/sonangrai/imagecropNextJS) project. The CropQ project in particular inspired me to try building something similar on my own — it showed me how a clean and thoughtful UI can make a big difference.

## What I Hope to Learn from This Club
I'm looking forward to learning how real-world open-source collaboration works — from managing pull requests to understanding project structure and contributing clean code. I also hope to connect with like-minded developers and sharpen my Git and GitHub workflow.
