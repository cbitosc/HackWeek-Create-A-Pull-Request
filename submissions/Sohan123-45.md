**Name and Background:**
Hi, I'm Dintakurthi Sohan, a third-semester Computer Science and Engineering student at Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology (CBIT). My hobbies include reading novels and drawing, which help me stay creative and focused. I'm also good at badminton and occasionally play football and volleyball.
Though I'm usually quiet and reserved, I open up once I get to know someone and enjoy meaningful conversations. I'm just a regural guy with a bit of curiosity, especially in the fields of technology.

**Open Source Project**
Godot Engine
It is free open source platform to make 2D and 3D games. More than playing games, building them makes me more interested. I want to build games but haven’t built any yet, but I’m actively learning the tools and exploring ideas.

**Learning Goals and Expectations:**
Attending the COSC Club’s tech fest completely blew my mind—the games like Decipher, Mazerift and Odyssey were insanely creative. The Git/GitHub seminar that you guys gave was very informative. I’m excited to boost my skills, dive into open-source, and build cool stuff with the club. I want to learn about various tools that can be used to make projects like the games you built etc. I expect that the club gives these various types of challenges to boost our knowledge.
