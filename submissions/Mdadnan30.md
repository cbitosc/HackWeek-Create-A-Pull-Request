### Background

I love playing video games and most of the sports especially football. I like to create unique type of projects with my friends for the better.

### Open Source Project I Admire

The open source project that i admire is Deepseek, the team really shook the whole world when they launched and they did what no other AI chatbot could do which was providing the reasoning model for free and faster repsonse times and better result in a very low budget.

### What I Hope to Learn

I hope to learn new technologies and perfect myself in creating new projects and i also hope to learn many other new languages and not only learn but i hope to learn how to implement it in any project, i would also like to explore areas like DevOps and System Design. I hope by the end of this i will become a good decent player in this field.
