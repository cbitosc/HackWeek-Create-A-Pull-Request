Background
Iâ€™m a final-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in AI, ML, and agentic systems. I enjoy building end-to-end projects that combine AI with web development, security, and automation.

Open Source Project You Admire
I admire LangChain for making it easier to build LLM-based applications. Its modular tools for agents, memory, and tool use make complex AI systems more accessible.

What Do You Hope to Learn from This Club?
I want to deepen my understanding of AI workflows, collaborate on real-world projects, and learn how to contribute effectively to open source communities.
