My self B Duurgaa prasad reddy i completed my schooling from Narayana co campus and intermediate education from Narayana junior collage and currently studying in chaitanya bharathi institute of technology and my degree is BE. in Information technology and currently i'm living in hyderabad
The open source project i admire mostly is Tensorflow  .It is a opensource framework for machine learning and aritificial intelligence. It provides various tools which makes easier to build models and deploye them ,It also supports varius applicatioins from NLP(Natural language processing) and computer visioin to reinforcement learning.which is very intresting.
I hope to improve my dev skills and contribute to more opensource projects and learn from my peers and senoirs . Being part of COSC club will give me many opportunities to improve and build myself for future career options and also expecting further similar hack_weeks and  events.
