## About Me

I am a CSE, 1st year, student. I have an interest in Deep Learning, Promp Engineering and Web Development.

## Open Source Projects that I like

I first came across the first-Contributions project. It has helped me learn the basics of Github. Later I came across the freeCodeCamp project. It's a beginner friendly project that is helping me navigate through the topics. 

## What I hope to learn from this club 

I hope to learn how to put everything that I learn to use. I have learnt a few languages but putting them to pratical usage has been quite a task from me. I hope to bridge that gap.
