Name : Prakash Samanta

Background : Currently pursing MERN stack, Studied At KPB Group of Hinduja College. Highly interested in web development and open source.

One Open-Source Project I Admire:
Currently, I am new to open source and only have minimal knowledge about it. However, as a developer, I use and spend a lot of time on VS Code. I highly admire VS Code because of its versatility and rich functionality. It also has a large and supportive community, which is very helpful.

What I Hope to Learn from This Club:
I hope to learn many new things about open source, coding, and various other experiences. This includes understanding how to make effective contributions, developing collaboration skills, and learning about the different phases of development. I'm really excited to explore and learn about the upcoming opportunities and gain meaningful experiences.
