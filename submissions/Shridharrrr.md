Hi, I’m **Shridhar**, a Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in **AI/ML** and **web development**. I enjoy building smart, user-friendly tech solutions and love working on projects that solve real-world problems. My background includes both personal and academic projects where I’ve combined machine learning with full-stack development.

I really admire **[Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/)** — a widely-used open-source Java servlet container. I find it fascinating because it plays a key role in backend web deployment, is lightweight yet powerful, and has excellent community support. It helped me understand the fundamentals of Java web apps and server-side infrastructure.

I'm excited to:

* Contribute to collaborative, real-world projects
* Learn best practices in **Software Development and Machine Learning**
* Explore how community-driven development can solve impactful problems
