<h1>Open source projects</h1>
<h3>
  I am still new to the world of open-source projects. This is my first open-source contribution.
  However, I really admire the idea that developers from all over the world can collaborate to build software that is freely available to everyone. 
  I am excited to learn more about different open-source projects.

<h1>My expectations from this club</h1>

  I hope to learn how to contribute effectively to open-source projects, improve my collaboration and communication skills, 
  and gain practical experience. I also want to connect with other likeminded peers and gain knowledgeable insights from seniors
