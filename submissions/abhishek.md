## Hi, I’m Abhishek!

### Background
I’m a student passionate about technology, web development, and learning new skills.

###  One Open Source Project I Admire
[VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) – because it's developer-friendly and open to contributions from around the world.

### What I Hope to Learn from This Club
I want to learn how real-world projects work, how to contribute to meaningful codebases, and collaborate with other developers.
