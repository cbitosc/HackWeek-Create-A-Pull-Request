## About Me
My name is **Ratna Saathvika Varanasi**, and I’m currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering (AI & ML) at **GNITS**. I have a strong interest in software development and a growing passion for open-source collaboration.

## Open-Source Project I Admire
One open-source project I really admire is **TensorFlow**, as it has made machine learning accessible to developers at all levels and has a strong, active community that constantly contributes to its growth.

## What I Hope to Learn from This Club
From this club, I hope to improve my coding skills, collaborate on real-world projects, and learn more about how open-source development works — from contributing to repositories to understanding version control and team workflows.
