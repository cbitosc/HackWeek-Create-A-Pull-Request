**Open Source Project I Admire**  
Hugging Face Transformers â€“ for democratizing access to state-of-the-art NLP models and fostering a collaborative open-source AI community.

**What I Hope to Learn**  
I want to improve my collaboration skills, gain hands-on experience with Git/GitHub workflows, and understand how large-scale open-source projects are built, maintained, and scaled.
