### Background
I'm an IT student at CBIT with a passion for technology and creative coding. I enjoy exploring new programming languages and building projects.

### Open Source Project I Admire
I really admire the [p5aholic/playground](https://github.com/p5aholic/playground) project. It features creative coding experiments and interactive typography, which inspire me to explore the artistic side of programming.

### What I Hope to Learn
I want to learn how to contribute to open source, work with others, and grow my skills as a developer.
