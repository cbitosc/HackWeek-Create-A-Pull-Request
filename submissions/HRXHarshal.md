### Name:
Harshal Dharmapal Bagade

### Background :
I'm a pre-final year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT (ISM) Dhanbad. I have a strong interest in software development, particularly in building full-stack web applications and solving real-world problems through code.

### Open Source Project I Admire :
I truly admire [**NewsNinja**](https://github.com/AIwithhassan/newsninja) â€” an AI-powered news aggregator and audio summarizer. It seamlessly combines breaking headlines with Reddit's raw discussions to generate personalized audio briefings. The way it integrates AI, automation, and user personalization reflects not only technical depth but also thoughtful problem-solving aimed at simplifying information overload. It inspires me to explore how AI can be used to enhance everyday experiences.

### What I Hope to Learn :
I hope to gain hands-on experience contributing to collaborative projects, enhance my understanding of open-source workflows, and deepen my knowledge of scalable software design. Being part of this club will also help me connect with like-minded developers and grow as a contributor in the open-source community.
