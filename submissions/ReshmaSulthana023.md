# P.Reshma Sulthana

## Background:
 Completed my first year of B.E in Information Technology at CBIT(Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology).During my first year,I learned:
`-The fundamentals of programming in C.
`-Explored Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++.

I am currently part of AFE(Amazon Future Enginner) Bootcamp.I have also been selected for the second phase of the program.The knowledge that I have gained are:
`-Basic knowledege of Python.
`-Introduction to Generative AI.
 Now continuing my DSA journey using JAVA.

 ## One open-source project I admire:
   ### GIT
   Without Git,none of the projects would be as easy to develop or contribute to.It enables branching,merging,pull requests and teamwork.
   Knowing Git is a fundamental skill for anyone entering software,open-source or tech industries.
   Git is the foundation for GitHub,VS Code Git and open source contribution.
 ## What do I hope to learn from this club:
 Learning and upskilling with like-minded people.I want to learn how to collaborate effictively on open-source projects,understand how large projects are structured,improve my Git and GitHub skills,and contribute meaningful code or documentation to real-world projects.
