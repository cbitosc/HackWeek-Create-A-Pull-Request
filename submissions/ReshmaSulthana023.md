# P. Reshma Sulthana

## Background:
I have completed my first year of B.Tech in Information Technology at CBIT (Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology). During my first year, I learned the fundamentals of programming in C and explored Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++. 

I am currently part of the Amazon AFE (Amazon Future Engineer) Bootcamp, through which I have gained basic knowledge of Python and an introduction to Generative AI. I have also been selected for the second phase of the program and am now continuing my DSA journey using Java.

## One open-source project I admire:
I admire *GIT* â€“ it is a free and open-source distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects, manage code versions, and easily revert to previous states. Essentially, it's a tool that helps developers keep track of their work and collaborate effectively. 

## What do I hope to learn from this club:
I want to learn how to collaborate effectively on open-source projects, understand how large projects are structured, improve my Git and GitHub skills, and contribute meaningful code or documentation to real-world projects.
