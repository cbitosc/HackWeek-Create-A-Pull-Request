## Thanav Reddy

### Background
I'm a computer science student passionate about web development,AI,block chain and testing

### Open Source Project I Admire
I really admire [Next Js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) project. Next.js is a powerful open-source React framework for building fast, scalable web apps with features like server-side rendering, API routes, and static site generation. It's actively maintained, widely adopted, and beginner-friendlyâ€”making it a great project to learn modern web development and contribute meaningful improvements.

### What I Hope to Learn
I want to gain knowledge about technologies that i dont know about and contribute to open source in the fields that im good at and gain expertise in those
