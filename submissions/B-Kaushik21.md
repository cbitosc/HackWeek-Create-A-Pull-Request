# Your Name
Hi, I'm Boddula Kaushik. 

## Background
Information Technology student eager to tackle real-world challenges, contribute to meaningful projects, and gain valuable hands-on experience. I am excited to apply my knowledge, collaborate with others, and continue learning in a practical setting.

## An Open Source Project I Admire
One open-source project I truly admire is **TensorFlow**. It's a powerful and flexible machine learning framework developed by Google. I love how it's accessible to both beginners and professionals, supports multiple languages, and enables the building of everything from simple ML models to advanced neural networks powering real-world applications like image recognition, natural language processing, and more. Its huge community and extensive documentation make it one of the best ecosystems to learn and contribute to.


## What I Hope to Learn
From this Open Source Club, I hope to gain hands-on experience in contributing to real-world projects, improve my understanding of collaborative development using Git and GitHub, and strengthen my skills in areas like version control, debugging, clean code practices, and eventually making meaningful contributions to big projects like TensorFlow.
