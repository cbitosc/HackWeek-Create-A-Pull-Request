## Background:
My name is Rohan Pagadala. I am a computer science student with a strong interest in machine learning and AI. I enjoy building practical ML projects and exploring how models can be used to solve real-world problems like image recognition, speech processing, and predictive analytics.

## One Open-Source Project I Learned From:
One open-source project I’ve learned a lot from is [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn). It helped me understand key machine learning techniques such as regression, classification, and clustering. Its simple and consistent API made it easy for me to experiment with different models and grasp foundational ML concepts.

## What I Hope to Learn from This Club:
From this open source club, I hope to learn how to collaborate on ML-related open-source projects, improve my knowledge of model development and deployment, and strengthen my Git and GitHub skills. I’m also excited to contribute to real-world codebases and grow as a developer by learning from others in the community.
