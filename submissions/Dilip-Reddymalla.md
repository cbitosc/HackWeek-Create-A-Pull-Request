I'm Reddymalla Dilip
I'm a Computer Science student from CBIT with a  passion for Web Development and Artificial Intelligence. I enjoy building interactive web applications and exploring how AI can solve real-world problems. I’m always eager to explore new ideas and deepen my knowledge in these evolving fields.

Open Source Project I Admire
One open-source project I truly admire is Appwrite. Appwrite is a self-hosted backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that helps developers build secure, scalable, and fast web and mobile applications with ease. It offers features like authentication, databases, storage, and serverless functions—all with simple and developer-friendly APIs. I find it incredibly useful because it reduces backend setup time and allows developers to focus more on building amazing frontends.

What I Hope to Learn
I hope to build consistency and discipline in my daily development practice. I want to dive deeper into open source, enhance my development skills, and gain real experience in areas like task management, collaboration, and understanding how large-scale projects are structured. Most importantly, I hope to grow as a developer by contributing meaningfully and learning something new every day.
