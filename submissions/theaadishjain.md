### Name and Background  
Hi, I’m Aadish Jain. I’ve joined this event to learn new things, work on open-world projects, and engage in practical challenges that go beyond classroom learning. I’m enthusiastic about building real-world skills and growing through hands-on collaboration.

### One Open-Source Project I Admire  
I really admire [Apidog-MCP-Server](https://github.com/apidog/Apidog-MCP-Server) — it’s a well-structured and actively maintained project that helps streamline API management and mock server capabilities, which I find very practical and useful for backend development.

### What I Hope to Learn from This Club  
I hope to understand the open source contribution process better, collaborate with like-minded peers, and become more confident working with real-world codebases and development workflows.
