# Name and Background
Hi! I'm Sai Mohaneesh, a Data Science student who’s really excited about technology, open source, and building things that actually help people. I love learning by doing, and that’s what drew me to this open-source journey.

# One Open Source Project I Admire
One project I truly admire is [**Scikit-learn**](https://scikit-learn.org/). It's a fantastic machine learning library — powerful, yet so easy to use. It’s amazing how it makes complex algorithms accessible to students, researchers, and developers alike.

# What I Hope to Learn From This Club
I’m here to learn how real-world collaboration works — how people across the world come together to build something meaningful. I want to get better at using GitHub, contributing to projects, and being part of a community that shares knowledge and grows together.
