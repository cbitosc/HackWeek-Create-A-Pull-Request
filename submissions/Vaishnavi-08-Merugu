👋 Hi, I'm Laksh Jain

🎓 I'm an IT student with a passion for **full-stack development**, **artificial intelligence**, and building tech that solves real-world problems.  
💡 Whether it's a personal side project or a college assignment, I love bringing ideas to life — especially if they can make someone's experience better.

## 🚀 Open-Source Project I Admire

# 🚀 Open-Source Project I Admire

One open-source project I find really useful and beginner-friendly is [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).  
It’s a massive, curated list of free APIs across categories like weather, games, news, health, and more — all contributed by developers around the world. It’s super helpful for anyone learning to build projects, especially web apps, because you get access to real-world data without needing to set up complex backends. I admire the simplicity of contributing (just a JSON or markdown entry) and how it helps developers discover new tools and ideas to build with.

Joining this club is a step toward becoming a better developer **and a better collaborator**. Here's what I'm looking forward to:

- 💬 Contributing to real-world open-source projects
- 🤝 Collaborating with like-minded tech enthusiasts
- 🛠️ Learning more about DevOps, system design, and scalable architecture
- 🔍 Getting exposure to team-based workflows like issue tracking, code reviews, and CI/CD

Ultimately, I want to grow both technically and as a teammate — and contribute meaningfully to projects that matter. 🙌
