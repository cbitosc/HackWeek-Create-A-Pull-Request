##  Name & Background
Hi, I’m Vijay Reddy Goli — a Computer Science student passionate about web development, AI, and building useful tech for students. I enjoy learning by building and exploring real-world projects.

##  Open Source Project I Admire
I really admire [FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) for making programming education accessible to everyone around the world.

##  What I Hope to Learn
From this club, I hope to:
- Understand the open-source contribution workflow (PRs, issues, forks)
- Collaborate with other devs
- Improve my Git and GitHub skills
- Start contributing meaningfully to real projects

Looking forward to growing together!
