Hi, my name is Siddhi and I’m from the IT department. I have a keen interest in technology and enjoy exploring new developments in the field. Outside of work, I’m a creative person with a passion for the arts. My hobbies include dancing, painting, and sketching, which allow me to express myself and unwind. I believe in balancing creativity with logic, and I enjoy opportunities that let me bring both aspects together.

Participating in COSC Hacktoberfest would be a great opportunity for me to enhance my technical skills, connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, and contribute meaningfully to exciting real-world projects. I’m really looking forward to being a part of this vibrant and impactful initiative.

From hands-on projects to unique events, there’s always something new to learn and be a part of. I genuinely enjoy participating in the creative and impactful initiatives they organize—it’s an inspiring community that constantly motivates me to grow. I’m sincerely looking forward to becoming a part of this amazing club and contributing in any way I can.
