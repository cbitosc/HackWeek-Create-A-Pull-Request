My name is John 

I am a studying Computer Science and Engineering. I am interested in full stack development 

The open source project I admire is Shadcn UI which is a great source for frontend components and it saved me a lot of trouble while designing frontend components

What I hope to learn from this club:
I want to explore about open source projects and how to implement them.
