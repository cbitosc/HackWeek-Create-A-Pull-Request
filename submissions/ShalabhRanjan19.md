Hi! This is Shalabh Ranjan, a computer science student from Bangalore with a strong interest in machine learning, DevOps, cloud computing, and frontend development. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through code and always eager to explore new technologies and workflows that push the boundaries of innovation.

One open-source project I admire is Pandas. It’s an incredibly versatile Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. I love how it simplifies complex data operations and accelerates the data preprocessing phase in machine learning .

From this club, I hope to learn how to contribute meaningfully to open-source communities, collaborate with other passionate developers, and deepen my skills in version control, project documentation, and issue tracking. I’m especially excited to understand how large-scale projects are structured and maintained, and how even small contributions can drive big impact.
