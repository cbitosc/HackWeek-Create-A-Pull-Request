## Name and Background
I'm Tejaswi Seelam, a B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I'm passionate about AI and Deep Learning, and I’ve had the opportunity to work on several interdisciplinary projects that combine concepts across domains. I enjoy exploring how AI can solve real-world problems and am continuously looking to deepen my understanding of these technologies.

## One Open-Source Project I Admire
One open-source project I admire is [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider). It’s a GPT-powered coding assistant that helps developers write and modify code using natural language, while keeping everything in sync with Git. I find it fascinating how Aider combines the power of AI with real-world software development workflows, making coding more intuitive and collaborative.

## What I Hope to Learn from This Club
Through this club, I aim to enhance my practical skills in open-source contribution, collaborate with like-minded tech enthusiasts, and explore a wide array of emerging technologies. I’m particularly interested in working on impactful AI-driven solutions and learning best practices in development, version control, and teamwork.
