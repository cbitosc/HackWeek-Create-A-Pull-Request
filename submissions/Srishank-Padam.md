#background
I'm a Computer Science student with experience in Python, C, and C++, along with a foundational understanding of data structures. I'm really interested in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science and want to explore more by working on real-world projects and contributing to open source.

#Open Source Project I Admire
I admire FreeCodeCamp for its incredible commitment to free, accessible, and structured learning resources. It has empowered countless developers, including myself, to learn and grow without barriers.

#What I Hope to Learn
Through this club and open-source collaboration, I hope to improve my practical coding skills, become more comfortable with Git/GitHub workflows, and understand how large-scale open-source projects are structured and maintained.
