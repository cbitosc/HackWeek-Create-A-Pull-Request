## About Me
Hi! My name is Sathwik Surineni. I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science. I have a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and its real-world applications, especially in fields like computer vision and natural language processing. As a beginner, Iâ€™m excited to explore how AI models are trained, tested, and deployed in real-life projects.
## Open Source Project I Admire
One open-source AI project I admire is Hugging Face. It is known for its Transformers library, which makes it easy to use powerful AI models for tasks like text generation, translation, summarization, and question answering.

I find Hugging Face interesting because it allows beginners like me to explore natural language processing (NLP) without needing deep knowledge of machine learning. With just a few lines of code, you can build amazing applications. It also has a strong and friendly community, and many tutorials and examples that make learning easier. Hugging Face is helping make AI tools open, accessible, and useful for everyone.

## What I Hope to Learn
I hope to learn how to contribute effectively to open-source projects, improve my knowledge of tools like Git and GitHub, and become more confident in collaborating on code with others. This club will help me bridge the gap between learning and doing.
