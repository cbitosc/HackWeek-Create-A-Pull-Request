Hi! I'm Akhil, a first-year AIML student at National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra .
I'm passionate about exploring the world of technology and engineering and eager to learn, grow, and contribute to innovative projects.
I enjoy problem-solving, exploring new tools, and working on collaborative projects. 
My current goals are Building a solid foundation in programming, data analysis, machine learning and participating in tech competitions, and internships to gain hands-on experience. 
I would love to connect with industry professionals and peers to learn about emerging technologies.
While I'm early in my journey, I bring curiosity, adaptability, and a strong willingness to learn.
I'm always open to guidance, mentorship, and opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects.
Let's connect if you're passionate about technology or have insights to share-l'd love to hear from you!
