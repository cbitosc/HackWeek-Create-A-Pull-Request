# Ramcharan Polabathina

I'm Ram, a CSE student who enjoys low-level design, system architecture, and building things from scratch — whether it's backend services, developer tools, or internal systems.

### 🔓 Open Source Project I Admire

I haven't contributed yet, but I really admire tools like **Ollama** and other open-source AI projects for how they bring complex models to local systems. Most of the tools I use daily — from frameworks to CLIs — are open-source.

### 🤝 What I Hope To Learn From This Club

I want to understand how open-source collaboration works — especially version control, contribution etiquette, and how to read and work with large codebases effectively.
