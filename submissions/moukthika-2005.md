# Tulasi Sree Moukthika

I'm currently a student passionate about software development and open source. I have experience in web development and love learning new technologies.

## Open-source project I admire
I really admire [HTTPie](https://github.com/httpie/httpie) for how it simplifies API testing with a clean CLI interface.

## What I hope to learn from this club
I want to improve my collaboration skills, understand how real-world projects are managed, and contribute meaningfully to open source.
