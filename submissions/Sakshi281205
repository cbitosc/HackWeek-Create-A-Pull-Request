I am a passionate and determined B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, 
aspiring to make meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving field of computer science. 
My journey is fueled by a deep love for coding and problem-solving, coupled with a meticulous, 
perfectionist approach that ensures every task I undertake is completed with excellence.

Beyond academics, I thrive on challenges and embrace a vibrant lifestyle. 
Whether itâ€™s playing sports, dancing, exploring new places, or sampling diverse cuisines, 
my adventurous spirit inspires creativity and fuels my drive to think outside the box. 
These experiences have also shaped my ability to adapt and connect with people from diverse backgrounds.

I am committed to continuous learning and personal growth, 
eagerly seeking opportunities to expand my technical expertise and apply it to innovative projects. 
With a blend of passion, dedication, and a zest for life, I look forward to exploring avenues 
where I can contribute and grow, both as a professional and an individual.


ONE OPEN SOURCE PROJECT I ADMIRE:
If I were to be completely honest, there is no single open sourced project that happens to be my favourite.
This is because the entire of concept of having a project that can be accessed by everyone in itself is a great job.
The fact that people could have used these projects to earn money, but they are giving free access to everyone makes it 
very admirable overall.


WHAT DO I HOPE TO LEARN FROM COSC?
From cosc i hope to hone my skills more, learn how to be able to contribute to existing open source platforms and take part
in more competitions and learn as much as possible.
