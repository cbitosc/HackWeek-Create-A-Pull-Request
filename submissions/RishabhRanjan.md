Hello, I'm Rishabh Ranjan and I'm in my third year of B. Tech, specializing in CSE-AI. My specialization is in full stack development, particularly using the MERN stack. I try hard to build applications that are both user-friendly and scalable, along with implementation of AI in real-time cases. My hobby is basically solving problems using clean code, on an everyday basis as learning new tech improves my skill set.

I'm really impressed with FreeCodeCamp for providing valuable and open-source education to developers all over the world. Their platform teaches coding, data structures, and full stack development for free so the empowered learners can create projects, obtain certifications, and contribute to real-world open-source codebases. This makes open-source learning accessible to anyone regardless of background or geographical location.

I expect to gain knowledge about large-scale codeBases through practice and learning workflow practices that real-everything teams do while understanding effective approaches to open-source contributions. This will sharpen my collaboration and Git skills and give me the confidence to contribute to significant software projects, like any professional developer out there.
