## About Me
I'm a Civil Engineering student with a growing interest in cybersecurity, Python development, and solving real-world problems through tech. I enjoy building tools — from simple CLI utilities to web projects. I also maintain a portfolio to document my learning and progress.

## Open Source Project I Admire
I really admire [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) — it's a powerful, beginner-friendly tool for web application security testing. It strikes a great balance between being educational and effective in real-world use, making it an inspiration for aspiring cybersecurity professionals like me.

## What I Hope to Learn
Through this club, I want to improve my Git/GitHub skills, get better at collaborating on open-source projects, and understand how real-world software is developed and maintained. I’m looking to build consistency, contribute regularly, and learn from a community of similar minded developers.
