Hello, I'm Meenakshi Sindhuja, a dedicated and enthusiastic Information Technology student currently in my second year of undergraduate studies. I completed both my 10th and 12th education at Kendriya Vidyalaya, where I built a strong academic foundation and developed a growing passion for technology.

I am a coding enthusiast with a particular interest in data — how it’s stored, analyzed, and used to make meaningful decisions. Over time, this interest has evolved into a clear career goal of becoming a Data Analyst. I am deeply curious about uncovering insights from data, solving real-world problems through analysis, and helping organizations make informed, data-driven decisions.

I am continuously exploring tools, concepts, and real-world applications related to data analytics, and I look forward to gaining more experience through projects, internships, and continuous learning. I am excited about the future and committed to growing into a skilled and impactful professional in the data field.
