# Deepak Prajapati

## Background
I'm a B.Tech IT student at CBIT Hyderabad, interested in web development, AI, and open-source collaboration.

## Open Source Project I Admire
I admire [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) for its huge impact on frontend development and strong community support.

## What I Hope to Learn
Through this club, I hope to improve my Git/GitHub skills, contribute to real-world projects, and become a confident open-source contributor.
